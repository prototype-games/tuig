# Tiled Integration
Tiled files are handled by lib.framework.resources.tiled. To be used in this codebase, use the lua file export. Also, importantly, have the tiled file in the same directory as where you want the final map file to be.

## load

### Loading Entities in the map
Any object-layer in the map will be entirely loaded into the game. 

## get_map

## unload
